//              Creates and handles Cnet-sessions.


/** Synapse network states/flow:
	
	CnetMan is threadsafe, Cnet is NOT.
	
	id is optional: when 0 it will assign an id automaticly.

	For clients:
		runConnect(id,host,port,reconnectTime)
			-> returns false if error 
			-> calls back connecting(id)
			on succesfull resolving and connecting:
				-> calls back connected(id)
				-> calls back connected_client(id);
				-> calls back received(id,...) for all incoming data until disconnected
			-> calls back disconnected(id,error); 
			if reconnectTime>0 and doDisconnect was not called: sleeps and starts over again..
			-> returns true;

	For servers:
		First call runListen to open the port:
		runListen(int port)
			-> returns false if error 
			-> listens on port, keeps running until user calls doClose(port) or until error
			-> returns true
							
		Now call runAccept to accept new connections:
		runAccept(int port, int id)
			-> returns false if errror
			-> calls back accepting(port,id)
			-> waits for new connection on port until user calls doDisconnect(id).or until error
			on newly accepted connection:
				-> calls back connected(id);
				-> calls back connected_server(id);
				-> calls back received(id,...) for all incoming data until disconnected
			-> calls back disconnected(id,error); 
			-> returns true;

	Writing data can be done with doWrite(..). Offcourse only after connected(id) was called back.
		if writing fails a disconnection occurs.

	Server and client code can be almost the same so its very easy to change your client into a server or vice versa: Only the first few steps are different, after the connection is eshtablised all the calls and callbacks are the same.
